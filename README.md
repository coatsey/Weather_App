# Weather_App

I made a simple weather app using a weather Api from https://open-meteo.com/. This simple app was made in android stuido. When you first open the app it asks for permission to use device's location. Using the devices location gives the user a current tempeture, what the weather type(sunny, cloudy, raining ex), along with humidity, wind speed and pressure. A few things that I liked to improve on is changing between fahrenheit and celsuius. Also id like to get a week long forcast.
